## Reflection
Project goals included working with Google APIs.During this time I also researched authentication using Google OAuth protocol and how it can be used to gain limited access to a user's private resources. I also learned how to integrate Google Calendar into the web application.The technologies used in this project are ReactJS for the frontend, NodeJS for the backend, Google OAuth for authentication and Google Calendar API for scheduling meetings.
